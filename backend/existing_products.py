Problem:
Data practitioners and public agencies struggle to anonymize sensitive data robustly and in compliance with regulations, especially for complex free-text data. Existing open-source and commercial solutions are inadequate or require significant customization efforts.

Impact:
Without a robust anonymization tool, agencies face high development costs, inefficient data sharing, and compliance risks, slowing AI and data-driven projects.

Problem:
Government officers spend excessive time manually processing, extracting, and verifying information from millions of documents annually. This process is inefficient, prone to human errors, and diverts resources from higher-value tasks.

Impact:
Automating document processing could save over 1.67 million man-hours annually, improving government service efficiency, reducing delays, and reallocating manpower to critical decision-making tasks.

Problem:
The current document verification process is inefficient, costly, and prone to fraud. Hard copies and PDFs are difficult to authenticate, machine-read, and revoke, leading to slow verification, data security risks, and high operational costs.

Impact:
Without a solution, document fraud will escalate with GenAI, verification costs will increase, and government agencies risk lagging in global adoption of secure digital credentials.

Problem:
Managing multiple property leases is disorganized, time-consuming, and error-prone. Paper contracts, spreadsheets, and disconnected systems make it difficult to track renewal dates, rent increases, maintenance responsibilities, and tenant communication, leading to missed deadlines, compliance issues, and revenue leakage.

Impact:
Without a solution, property owners face increasing administrative burden, legal exposure from compliance failures, strained tenant relationships, and reduced profitability as portfolio size grows.
